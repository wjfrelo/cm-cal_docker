Network Drivers

- bridge : The default network driver. Usually used when applications run in standalone containers that communicate.

- host   : For standalone containers. Uses the Docker host networking directly. The host networking driver only works
           on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker Desktop for Mac, Docker Desktop for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server.

- overlay: Connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services comms. Used when communication between swarm service and standalone container,
           or between two standalone containers on different Docker daemons.

- macvlan: Macvlan networks assignment of MAC address to container, making it appear as a physical device. The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses.
           Using the macvlan driver is sometimes the best choice when dealing with legacy applications that expect to be directly connected to the physical network.

- none   : For this container, disable all networking. Usually used in conjunction with a custom network driver. none is not available for swarm services. See disable container networking.
